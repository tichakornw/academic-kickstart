I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href='https://www.cs.iastate.edu'>Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href='https://www.iastate.edu/'>Iowa State University</a>, where I also serve as the director of the Autonomous Systems Laboratory. In addition to my academic role, I hold a Visiting Academic position with Amazon Robotics. I received a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 2010 under the supervision of <a href='http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/wiki/Main_Page'>Prof. Richard Murray</a>.

My research interests lie in the broad area of computer science, control, and optimization, with a particular focus on formal methods, motion planning, situational reasoning, hybrid systems, and distributed control systems. Most of my work involves applying mathematical and computational rigor to solve concrete, real-world problems, especially in autonomy, robotics, and transportation.

A significant portion of my career has been devoted to the development of autonomous vehicles, both in academia and industry settings. In particular, I was a principal research scientist and led the planning team at <a href='https://www.aptiv.com/solutions/autonomous-mobility'>nuTonomy</a> (now <a href='https://hyundai-aptivad.com/'>Hyundai-Aptiv Autonomous Driving Joint Venture</a>). As one of the earliest employees, I was heavily involved in the whole software development and release process, from design (interfaces and modules) to implementation (C++ and python), testing, evaluation, and deployment. My work focused on planning, decision making, control, behavior specification, and validation of autonomous vehicles. I also led the Systems Team for Team Caltech in the <a href='https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/darpa-urban-challenge'>2007 DARPA Urban Challenge</a> during my Ph.D.
